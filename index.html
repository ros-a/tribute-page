        <p id="intro">
            In 1919 Walter Gropius founded the art and design school Staatliches Bauhaus, more commonly known as Bauhaus. Rejecting the elitist and conservatist schools of the past, Bauhaus aimed to break down the barriers between art and craftmanship. Although the school only lasted 14 years, its short existence did not limit its impact. By the time the Nazi regime closed down the school in 1933, Bauhaus had grown into something much bigger: a new way of thinking had emerged, celebrating interdisciplinarity, diversity and experimentation over all else.
